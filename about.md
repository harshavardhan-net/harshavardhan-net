### Work and Career

I started career with a Bangalore based training company that specializes in communication skills training for unemployed youth. I along with a team of five people successfully placed over 350 young aspirants in IT/ITES MNC’s within one calendar year back in 2010. Sessions included grammar and sentence formation, fluency, and accent neutralization.

Later, I worked with a UK based company which imparted soft skills to college students, government school teachers, and general public. During this tenure as an english language resource center manager, I traveled in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and met several students and teachers, educating them on communicative english and corporate etiquette.

In 2014, I joined a US based IT company specializing in Enterprise Software Services and has since been working with IT employees enhancing their soft skills as per clients’ requirements.
